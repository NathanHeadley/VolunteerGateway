Well, you probably all have ideas of your own, but the very best mentors are helpful, positive, trustworthy and able to keep things confidential. You need to be reliable, empathetic and able to question people sensitively, as well as being able to share your own experiences in a useful way. Also a good understanding of the barriers faced by people with depression and the issues facing them is also helpful in the relationship. However the most important thing of all is to care. You don't even need to be qualified - as long as you have ears and are willing to listen, you're right for us.
