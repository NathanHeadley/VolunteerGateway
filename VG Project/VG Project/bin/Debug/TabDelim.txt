Residential Volunteering	VO38312	1	Lothlorien Community (Rokpa Trust)	Mental Health	Voluntary Co-worker	"Becoming a voluntary co-worker at Lothlorien offers a valuable opportunity for personal growth, and will be of particular interest to those considering a career in a helping profession. Rather than learning particular skills or techniques in helping others, the main learning for co-workers, is through participation in a community which actively promotes honesty, genuine communication and mutual support. The main focus of the co-worker's role is that of befriending. They help to create a warm, accepting atmosphere of friendship, acceptance and mutual support, through which everyone in the community feels valued and respected. Co-workers are also expected to help maintain the daily structure and routine that underpins life in the community. This involves participating in domestic tasks such as cooking, cleaning, working in the organic vegetable gardens and maintenance work on the house and grounds."	"Lothlorien is a therapeutic community, where those who are experiencing mental health problems can develop their potential through living alongside people who are relatively well, in an atmosphere of friendship, acceptance and mutual support. The community consists of 8 people with mental health problems and 4 voluntary co-workers, living in a large log house on 17 acres of land. The 3 staff, who provide a continuity of support to the community, are non resident. The staff also offer individual and group supervision to the voluntary co-workers. At Lothlorien, we believe that people need not be imprisoned by their past and we avoid labelling or diagnosing people. Instead, we attempt to break down the distinction which frequently exists between those seen as 'well' and those seen as 'unwell'. We have a strong belief in everyone's potential for well being, even in the midst of pain and distress."

Marketing / PR / Media	VO38892	10	Transform Community Development	Homeless / Housing	Leaflet distributor/promoter	We need to advertise our Furniture Project. Can you help us by distributing leaflets and contacting businesses around Dundee to promote our services? This role is vital to the organisation in that it is the primary method of promoting our services to both other businesses and the public. The role will involve building a rapport in order to inform potential customers of what we offer in terms of furniture for sale and donations required. This can include office furniture to be promoted by cold calling on businesses or residential furniture which we hope the public will donate to our project. The business marketing has the advantage of allowing volunteers to use various interpersonal skills and also highlight that as opposed to a standard sales pitch we are actually offering a terrific value product with proceeds benefitting a charitable cause. The leaflet distribution in residential areas is fundamental to the project?s sustainability and does not require any special skills but if the volunteer has a good manner with the public then this would be encouraged to form positive relationships and promote the good work we do in the community. The opportunity would suit outgoing individuals who like to communicate and work with the public. Leaflet distribution will require posting door to door. The office furniture will be promoted amongst other businesses often in business parks around Dundee.
